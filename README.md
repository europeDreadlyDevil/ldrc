## Linux Docker Rust Compiler
This is just an early version of my application so, only compilation under Linux Ubunta is available.
Maybe I will further develop this project and add more architectures in the future.

## How to use
You need Docker and Rust to use it

### Install CLI
```powershell
cargo install ldrc
``` 

### Start compile
--path is path to your main folder of Rust project
```powershell
ldrc --path .
```
